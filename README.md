# NeuralNetworkI-_C
I have made a study on how neural networks work in the background. For this, I searched for tutorials on YouTube and found this guy who coded a neural network using C without libraries. So, I watched the video and ended up developing my own. on backgroud, for this i serached for some tuturials on youtube  and found this guy who created a NN using C whitout libraries. So a whatched the video and ended developing my own

This neural network can learn how a logical XOR gate works. By running through several epochs, it was able to achieve an incredible accuracy.
